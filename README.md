# ParkingTicketPredsLA

A forecasting application for the amount of parking tickets in LA.

This is an app with the purpose of displaying some nice facts on the amount of parking tickets for different district of LA.

## Requirements

First, you need pip. Second, you should run it using docker. I mean, I guess you could run it using a venv and a just running index.py, but what fun would that be? Third of all, you need your own Kaggle API, and place your `kaggle.json` file inside `secrets` directory (if you want to run this using docker, otherwise just place it directly in `~/.kaggle directory`), that should be created when you installed the kaggle package.
